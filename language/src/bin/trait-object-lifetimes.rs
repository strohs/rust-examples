/// This code compiles without any errors, even though we havenâ€™t explicitly annotated the
/// lifetimes involved in obj. This code works because there are rules for working with lifetimes
/// and trait objects:
///  * The default lifetime of a trait object is 'static.
///  * With &'a Trait or &'a mut Trait, the default lifetime of the trait object is 'a.
///  * With a single T: 'a clause, the default lifetime of the trait object is 'a.
///  * With multiple clauses like T: 'a, there is no default lifetime; we must be explicit.
